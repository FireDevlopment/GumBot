# GumBot Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** January 17, 2026  
**Last Updated:** January 17, 2026  

**GumBot** (Application ID: 1458462560507527352) is a free, multipurpose Discord bot developed by FireDevelopment("we", "us", "our").  

By inviting GumBot to your Discord server, using its commands, or interacting with it in any way, you ("you", "your", "user") agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("ToS", "Terms"). If you do not agree, do not invite or use the bot.

These Terms are a legal agreement between you and the developer. They do not override or modify Discord's own [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines), or [Developer Terms](https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal). In case of conflict, Discord's official terms take precedence.

## 1. Eligibility
- You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your country) to use GumBot, in compliance with Discord's rules.
- By using GumBot, you represent that you meet this requirement.

## 2. License & Use
We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use GumBot in your Discord servers for personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms and Discord's policies.

You may not:
- Use GumBot for any illegal, harmful, abusive, or discriminatory purpose
- Attempt to exploit, reverse-engineer, modify, or interfere with the bot
- Spam, flood, or abuse commands in a way that disrupts the bot or servers
- Use GumBot to violate Discord's Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or any law
- Impersonate others, spread misinformation, or engage in harassment using bot features

## 3. Bot Features & Your Responsibility
GumBot provides tools such as moderation (ban/kick/mute), music playback, leveling/XP, tickets, fun commands, and more.  
You are solely responsible for:
- How you configure and use these features in your server
- Ensuring your use complies with all applicable laws and Discord rules
- Managing permissions granted to the bot in your server

We do not control or moderate content in your server — that's your responsibility as server owner/admin.

## 4. Prohibited Conduct
You agree not to:
- Use GumBot for spamming, raiding, self-botting, or token grabbing
- Circumvent rate limits, cooldowns, or anti-abuse measures
- Attempt to overload, crash, or DDoS the bot or its hosting
- Share malicious links/commands through the bot
- Use the bot to collect or store user data beyond what is necessary for its intended features

Violation may result in the bot ignoring you, blacklisting your user/server ID, or reporting to Discord.

## 5. Data & Privacy
For information about what data we collect and how we handle it, please see our separate [Privacy Policy](https://your-site-or-github-link/privacy).

## 6. Termination & Changes
We may suspend or terminate your access to GumBot at any time, without notice, for any reason (including suspected violation of these Terms or Discord rules).

We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use after changes means you accept the new version. We will try to notify users via bot message or support server announcement.

## 7. Disclaimer & Limitation of Liability
GumBot is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind.

To the maximum extent permitted by law:
- We are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising from your use (or inability to use) the bot
- This includes data loss, server issues, financial loss, or any harm from bot features/misuse

You use GumBot at your own risk.

## 8. Governing Law & Disputes
These Terms are governed by the laws of Nepal (or your country if mandatory). Any disputes will be resolved through discussion or appropriate legal channels.

## 9. Contact
